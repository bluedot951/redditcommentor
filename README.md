# Reddit Commentor&trade;

This project is a bot that generates Reddit comments for several subreddits, including the following:

 * `reddit.com`
 
 * ...list to be updated.

The comments are generated by using an n-gram learning model over billions of comments from Reddit dating back to 2005. The dataset was pulled from a [publicly available API](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/) and filtered prior to being used with the project, which only selected certain criteria to focus on when generating comments. The several tens of GBs of training data was used to develop a varied (albeit unstructured) model for generating comments in English.

More details will be made available as the project progresses.

The Reddit Commentor&trade; is created by [Shantanu Gore](http://github.com/bluedot951) and [Chirag Bharadwaj](http://www.chiragbharadwaj.com). They originally made it for their final project in [CS 4701: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4701/2017sp/) at [Cornell University](www.cs.cornell.edu) in Spring 2017.
