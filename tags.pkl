Meeting notes, Reports, technical specs Sign-up sheets, proposals and much more...", just like any other new breeed of sites that want us to store everything we have on the web. And they even guarantee multiple levels of security and encryption etc. But what prevents these web site operators fom accessing and/or stealing Meeting notes, Reports, technical specs Sign-up sheets, proposals and much more, for competitive or personal gains...? I am pretty sure that most of them are honest, but what\'s there to prevent me from setting up a good useful site and stealing all your data? Call me paranoid - I am. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] Like a lot of people I can\'t claim to know first-hand about the harsh realities of war.  That\'s why it matters a lot to me that McCain is the one leading the fight against torture in Washington.  He has a military background; he would not advocate something that would prevent us from defending ourselves.  And unfortunately for him he knows a lot about torture specifically.      Even the White House could not avoid noticing how bad it was for PR to have Cheney, who avoided service in Vietnam, advocating torture, and McCain, a war hero, speaking out against it.  So they\'ve switched to lying.  "We do not torture" is now the official line.  For some definition of "torture" that they know the hearer doesn\'t share.  Where have I heard this before?  "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." [EOC]'

p21
aS'[SOC] Comments? About time, I want to see what other people think about some articles. [EOC]'
p22
aS'[SOC] As Aaronsw points out, there\'s a big difference between Reddit comments and Slashdot comments.  Reddit comments are ranked. Which means not only that the lame stuff gets pushed to the bottom where you can ignore it, but that, because the order can change, users won\'t be tempted into the kind of it-is-so, it-is-not, it-is-so kind of interchange that makes Slashdot comments so tedious.    And of course there\'s no "frist post!" phenomenon, because the  graphically  first post is the one voted the best, not the first chronologically.    Plus you can take a real karma hit if you post something dumb that a lot of people mod down.  That should make people think twice.    Put all these together and I think comments on Reddit will end up being a lot better than on Slashdot. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] Wonderful! And it supports a limited amount of markup. I hope that the discussions will be respectful and edifying. It would be nice if the number of comments an entry had were displayed in the list view, and if the comment entry box were a bit larger  or resizeable . Oh, and does comment activity make something "hotter"?    Personally, I thought about leaving the site because the interaction that karma offers is pretty cold -- I certainly don\'t like seeing  -2  next to my name, and I feel like the negative ratings on legitimate articles are going to discourage some people. How are you guys rating articles? I tend to promote articles that I find interesting, leave alone things which are not of interest to me, and only demote articles which are old or obviously spam.

I think that if we\'re talking about "Web 2.0" companies, none of them are going to become the next Microsoft. The whole point seems to be releasing simple applications often -- there isn\'t a suite that\'s going to dominate the entire productivity market. Google -- with its reach and accumulated loyalty -- has the best chance of becoming the next Microsoft. [EOC]'
p34
aS'[SOC] Have you read slashdot lately? There are no comments on the front-page there either but their tone and idocy seeps through so even the real news stories are presented to a 4th grade reading level. And yes, I am a snob. I like reddit\'s emphasis on technical matters and programming but it not going to last long now. I guess it\'s the price of popularity.

I have also wondered sometimes why articles have a high rank, and wondered what others were thinking about it.    The web brings you the world, and I can\'t think of anything better than people thinking about it, writing about it, and having a dialog.  It engages the mind, shares insights, and people like "talking." [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] First, your claim that Slashdot presents stories to a fourth grade reading level is simply irrelevant.  As opposed to Slashdot, all Reddit has no front page commentary whatsoever.  If you don\'t want to see the "idocy" of all of the unwashed masses far beneath your pedestal, just don\'t click on "comments".    Second, this site is quite clearly not intended as a programming/tech specific site.  It\'s quite clearly not intended as an *anything* specific site.  If you love its degree of emphasis on programming and so forth, it should be quite simple for you to implement a similar site with a specific emphasis.  Reddit\'s functionality is not complicated, and as you are a programming and tech "snob" far above our "idocy", you should have no trouble duplicating it. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] I\'ve got to agree with the sentiment here.    I\'ve been trying to find evidence of this for ages, but I remember reading years ago that a large software company  I believe it was Sun Microsystems in the days before they bought Star Division  did some research on office software .  They found that so called "productivity" software was the single biggest productivity killer in their organisation.    Instead of developing clear, concise messages staff spend hours worrying about fonts and clip-art.    The result of this study was that the company banned the use of office software without express permission.  Everyone had to use plain-text e-mail for all communication.    Does anyone else remember that study?   Anyone have any links?  I\'d love to see it again as it is the missing lynch-pin from my anti-office software arguement  a pet topic of mine . [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] Women in the porn industry have had the upper hand  in terms of amount paid, compared to their male counterparts  for some time.  It follows that the balance of power and the creative control would follow them.  Thought experiment: count how many multi-millionaire male performers you can name?  I can\'t name one and have never heard mention of one.  Now the female?  Well, I can\'t remember their names, but I remember reading about them, and seeing referenes to them in various documentaries  HBO had one called something like "Sex in the Valley" .  There are lots of them.    Lastly, in the days before the internet, the porn was controlled by a few powerful distributors, who were, yes, male  and sometimes affiliated with the mafia .  The \'net has removed the power over distribution and created a level porn playing field.    Some say this exact thing is occuring right now regarding non-porn movies.  ifilm.com is certainly trying.  It\'s not clear anyone is listening, though.   [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] If you think the assassination was the only thing that caused WWI, you are *seriously* behind on things. [EOC]'
p80
aS'[SOC] Ah, interesting.  I guess I must\'ve missed the memo:    "WWI was actually caused by competition to exploit colonial resources, Germany\'s preemption of France as the major continental industrial power, Germany\'s attempt to build a competitor to the Royal Navy, and the entropic degradation of Bismarck\'s spiderwork of treaties when the Iron Chancellor himself was no longer around to manage them."      Now, let\'s ask an analogous question:  i Seriously /i , what is the US doing in Iraq?    I submit that the answer is likely to be more complicated than "Chimpy McHitlerburton lied to us about weapons of mass distraction!  Michael Moore told me so!"  Or, for that matter, "We done gawne inter Eye-rack t\' spread dumawkruhsee an\' the Gospel t\' th\' heathen."    If WWI is entitled to a  i serious /i  causal examination, why isn\'t the Iraq war so entitled?  Answer: attempting to write HISTORY while it\'s still happening is called POLITICS.    The pompous toad in this article has declared Iraq a stupid war.  Fine.  What kind of evidence does he have to back up his reasoning?  How many soldiers\' memoirs has he read  and deconstructed ?  How many Iraqi citizens has he interviewed?  How many members of the insurgency?  Or is he basing his judgements on reports from the western media  who have LESS information than the coalition\'s military leadership , and the Iraqi media in the run-up to a parliamentary election.    Even if you try to be objective under these circumstances, you\'re still going to reach conclusions that support the views you already hold.  Read Foulcault and Derrida if you don\'t believe me.  And then, if you have any kind of intellectual conscience, knock a point off this assinine submission so nobody has to see it again. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] It is true that there are many environments that simply will not run a perl interpreter, but those domains  including the ones that are too resource-tight even for java!  do offer other, arguably better options.  For instance, at a scheme conference in 2003  http://scheme2003.flux.utah.edu/  someone demonstrated a scheme running on a PIC microcontroller  I think it has 2K of ram .  They demonstrated nontrivial, useful programs.  It would seem that this demonstrates that you can get a cooler language than java into a smaller footprint than java's, which tends to vindicate the point of the original essay.  I have a whole page of resources for very small footprint scheme and lisp implementations, if anyone is interested. [EOC]"

This is probably the wrong forum for going into my reasons for saying that, but I thought I'd highlight my one major hangup:  the course is *too generic*.    This is not really the designer's fault, since the course is aimed at all scientists generally.  However, the scientists I tend to work with mostly have a biology background and  contrary to the course designer's claims about scientists in general  they do *not* take to the rigour of programming easily.  Just about the only way I've found of keeping their attention is by making the examples 100% focused and relevant to their field of expertise.    That said, I might well incorporate some of the elements of this course into my own next year. [EOC]"

p112
aS'[SOC] What your missing is that comparative advantage can only be realized with free trade. Free trade is a theory.    In this theory if goods had unfettered access between country A and B, both countries would specialize in what they are good at.    The U.S. with its high standard of living and education is more apt at making technology and culture driven products. For people in the U.S. to be farming does not make much sense, becuase they have access to better education and have more capital.  People in Africa have nothing, they could use nature to farm, and thats about all they can do.    So it would make sense for the Africans to do the farming and the US to build the websites to sell the farm produce.    But the Africans can not farm, because if they grew the produce they could not sell it to anyone, because the American stuff is already cheaper.    Of course, in the real world things are not that simple, not everyone in the U.S. is rich or has access to good education, and not everyone in Africa is destitute  but most are  I painted a pretty simple picture with that theory.    Furthermore the situation in Africa is worse then this. There is no infrastructure because all the governments are so corrupt. Bill Gates could throw all the money in the world at the diseases, but nobody over there is really getting innoculated. Most of the scientists getting special education are leaving africa. It really is a bad situation, one that people should put more effort into being aware of. Not everything is as peachy as we like to think, and after a recent talk with some people involved over there, I myself have been trying to find out more.

aS"[SOC] I agree with you on the three elements that converge into the Web 2.0 phenomena. This is why I suggest   webware   as the term that essentializes what the Web 2.0 is.  web  because it's a participative, social and global phenomena online.  ware  because it's about software allowing you to do online and with other people the things you would do alone and in your local computer. So,   webware   introduces you to the new Internet paradigm, the availability of social and personal software online. [EOC]"

The networked computer knows of an speeding incident, where it happened, time, and the police are just collecting funds for their local beat. In fact the police could be waiting at the client address when they get home, bill in hand. In the future a complete listing of mobile phone calls, shopping lists, petrol costs, emails sent, utility bills, council fines and community charges could be obtained via community police officers pdas on the beat. A knock on the door and a swipe of the bank card please, or you will be restricted under Asbo from driving your car and we will know, and what you did, said, brought, and when. All it will need next is a terrorism act to impose state control and thought and hello 'Nazi UK'.   [EOC]"
p124
aS"[SOC] This rationale was spelled out in a memo written by John Yoo, a White House attorney, less than two weeks after the attacks of 9/11. It's a dense read and a terrifying piece of legal contortionism, but it basically says that the president has unlimited powers to fight terrorism. He can spy on anyone, arrest anyone, and kidnap anyone and ship him to another country ... merely on the suspicion that he might be a terrorist. And according to the memo, this power lasts until there is no more terrorism in the world. [EOC]"

In Germany, every couple of months you can spot a headline somewhere saying something along the lines of "50% of Germans don\'t know the name of their current President  but 95% know the name Arnold Schwarzenegger ".    That\'s a basic flaw of any democracy. Most people are just uneducated or ignorant or don\'t have time to learn or can\'t be bothered knowing or remembering everything.     However, they are not retarded or mentally disabled, or even stupid. And that\'s why IQ tests simply won\'t work.     If you set the bar at an IQ of 50  or even 100 , most people will actually pass the test, even those who don\'t know the name of the current President. And if you set the bar at 200, then you end up with a few hundred people voting on the future of millions. Which by itself ain\'t bad -- you just can\'t call that democracy anymore. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] Classes that expose data instead of hiding it? Oh NO! Seriously, that isn't a problem at all. Some data is just data, and the most useful way to deal with it is to treat it as data. I'm not intimately familiar with the interface you're talking about, so I can't say whether this is right under the circumstances.    Also, Object Orientation is not a universal problem solver. When procedural code and raw data appear in object-oriented systems, figure out *first* whether it is the right solution. If it is, complain that the language does not support it better, not that it does not fit the artificial mold of object orientation. Quit pretending that OO is everything. OO is great for some things and not for others. [EOC]"
p131
aS'[SOC] Every time i think about computer languages, I have to think about people, because that\'s who the languages are really written for.    What if there\'s a global human "Blurb" paradox?

aS'[SOC] Measurement, Leverage, .... and Property Rights.    "Letting him keep it" is a way of saying that Property Rights are respected.    I only mention this because it makes it easier to understand why some industries act the way they do.  I am a lawyer, for instance.  Lawyers cannot patent or copyright their work, which leads to two pathologies.  Either  1  the work is made public and everyone gets to use it without paying the creator, or  2  the work is confidential and many customers who would be willing to pay for it don\'t get to because of the lawyer who knows the secret only has so much time in his day.    That\'s why the best lawyers charge $800/ hr. and any lawyer can get away charging with $200/ hr.  Does anyone really think that the best of the best are only four times better than the guys who had to take the Bar exam three times to pass it?  That doesn\'t make much sense to me.  I also know that if I work as hard as a computer programmer in a start-up, I\'ll get a lot of billabe hours, but my work will be filed with the SEC where all the world can see   copy it.

aS'[SOC] One nitpick:    "We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though theoretically the second is worth twice as much."    This reasoning holds for a lottery, say, where all you have to do is scratch the numbers, but in terms of something where you sink countless hours and mental energy, there is certainly an opportunity cost as well - in other words, what else could you have done during that time, and how much money would you have made.  To really calculate the relative values of the two options, you\'d have to factor in opportunity costs.    Of course, Paul\'s point stands, and the article is as well-written and  to me, at least , motivational, as well.  Now, if only I had a clever idea... [EOC]'

I wonder how well this whole do-what-users-want-not-what-you-are-good-at/interested-in strategy applies to startups that develop high-tech products  e.g., sw development tools, etc.  rather than use high-tech products to develop for consumers  e.g., web stores, etc. . I seriously doubt one can succeed in that area without any interest in and appreciation for technology one is working on. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] I wouldn't advocate doing stuff you're not at all interested in.  If there are several things you could do that users want, do the one you'll like most.  Just don't lie to yourself about whether users want it.      For example, the main reason Viaweb ended up being server-based was that we didn't want to have to write Windows apps.  But it was also a win for users; we weren't just doing it to suit our own tastes. [EOC]"

In other words you were using your favorite tool while working on something that you weren't truly interested in. If you are working on a product which itself is a tool from a domain that you are interested in, things change.    The nasty part comes in the fact that the better the tool one can create, the less likely it will be what  majority of  users want. Seems the only way out is to create the tool and to exploit it yourself.    [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] Great essay.  It concisely sums up how the economic world works in a way anyone could understand.      Except for one side argument.    It seems to me the article claims that for an economy to be successful it must let their wealth generators keep what they make.  That without this component the talented will have no incentive to create.    That may be the reason capitalism has been so successful, but are we sure our economy isn't just a local maximum?    Is there really no other reason to create wealth?    You argue that without this incentive everyone's output will be reduced to the mean as it is in a big bureaucratic business.    But you also state that no-one really like working this slow and that an engineer would work their ass off on sexy projects like fighter jets.  Open source is another example that shows there has to be more incentives to a person than just building wealth.    Maybe big business can't get as much out of their troops because the only incentive they can give is money.  What if they no longer needed to provide this.  What if they were forced to find something else to give their employees.  Would they be able to motivate people better than they do now?    Google has many top producers that no longer need personal wealth and yet they still seem to be innovating.      Maybe capitalism works so well because it's easy.  Letting people keep what they create takes relatively little infrastructure.    But, as the economy grows it seems to be getting harder.  We need more laws, more financial institutions, more cruft.  More wasted wealth.      Building the infrastructure of a central economy without corruption is a hard, risky problem.  But maybe at some point it will be cheaper than what we have now. [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] Yes, I think entrepreneurship can be taught, just like anything else.  We teach it at Y Combinator.  The problem is just that most of the people teaching it at universities don't have any first-hand experience of it.    How well a university can teach a subject depends on whether the teachers are the leading practitioners of it.  So colleges are good at teaching physics and medicine, beause the best physicists and doctors are professors; they're somewhat less good at teaching programming because the best hackers don't necessarily become professors; and they're terrible at teaching literature or entrepreneurship, because good writers and startup founders actively avoid becoming professors.

aS"[SOC] People are certainly motivated by more than money.  I don't need more and I keep working.  The motivations I know of are pleasure in the work, fame, benevolence, and money. I think a lot of the most tedious stuff will only be done for money.  For example, keeping a web server up and running.  That's not going to make you famous; it's not fun; and if you were motivated purely by benevolence you'd probably prefer to go to Africa where you could literally save lives.    Nearly all the economic infrastructure is like keeping a web server up and running.       You could make a case that improving the overall level of technology might save more lives in the long run, but I don't think benevolence is the main reason people work on it.  [EOC]"

p215
aS'[SOC] The author\'s conclusion, that "we\'ll be [unable] to influence the progression of internet communities" through technology alone, is contradicted by the contrast between various social sites. For example, the different posting mechanisms on Slashdot, Reddit, and Joel Spolsky\'s forums encourage different behavior. One could even try to prove that the functionality of the sites determines their respective audiences, though I don\'t have any data on this subject.    If people use the internet to reinforce their pre-existing views, then it is only because people don\'t actively seek to debunk what they believe. The technology forces nothing upon them. [EOC]'
p216
aS'[SOC] While it may seem self-evident that you create wealth by providing something people want, many business people forget this fact.    Some years ago, I turned to the dark side and got an MBA from Harvard Business School.  In my classes, I learned a lot about creating and capturing value.  Essentially, we\'re told that value equals the difference between willingness to pay and production cost.    The problem is that this equation reduces wealth to simple arithmetic, and encourages you to treat product creation as a simple case of lowering costs or increasing prices.    I started several businesses that focused on slicing and dicing cashflows and incentives.  While they had some success at making money, I wasn\'t really creating wealth.  I was just coming up with other ways to slice up the pie.    I\'ve seen the light since then, but a lot of other "suits" have not.  I\'m glad Paul made this essay available to the general public.

So they go to online communities that fit their view, and they only become further entrenched in it. Where as in real life, you are often forced into situations where you must deal with people of different views and behaviors, with the Internet and technology, you can go to these little islands of behavior and never see people who disagree with your mindset again.

aS" is incredible. They were once a struggling manufacturer of machinery. And then, in Paul's terms, they gave everybody enormous leverage -- to the point of picking their own bosses and influencing their own salaries. But they also published everyone's contribution to profits, from the firm all the way down to the individual. Not only did they get self-motivated workers and amazing results, but middle management withered away to nothing.    The smartest techies have intrinsic leverage since the company assets are located inside their heads. So the primary problem at a non-tech firm like Semco is inculcating the right democratic and entrepreneurial values.   [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] Additionally, if the citizenry did achieve this 'informed' status, and since politicians still do like to get elected and re-elected, they would have to vote in a way to please this 'informed' citizenry. Unless everytime the public elected a politician this politician went ahead and ignored the will of this citizenry, you would end up with plenty of incumbents.     Only at this theoretical point where citizens suddenly become informed might there be a mass replacement of congresspeople, but the dynamic changes would stabilize as servants of the informed began to hold political offices.    Use the 1994 congressional elections as an example where Christian/conservative constituents became more informed that their representatives were not serving their interests, which some people may not share, and power shifted right and  there generally has not been a huge shift since.     There is also the problem that people are selectively informed about different issues, and values these issues differently. This site reflects people informed enough to know what Lisp is, something most other people couldn't care about if it was brought to their attention.  [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] The worst form of procrastination I face is thinking without acting: reading things on Reddit, reading programming language manuals, and walking around my apartment with a cup of coffee or a beer. After reading this essay, I don\'t think the way to combat this type of procrastination is to stop thinking, but rather to put a limit on how long you let yourself think without acting.    You should know how to "implement" quickly in your field. For programming, that means actually writing code. For writing, that means getting words down on a page. In science, it must be conducting an experiment, no matter how shoddy.    Programmers and artists are blessed because they have easy ways to sketch. All fields have ways to sketch, though: someone looking to fix the U.S. healthcare system could create a simulation, or see how there plans would impact five different people that they know.

It seems like the objective of four years of BE is a job via campus recruitment  at some well-known company, or as a step towards an MBA from one of the IIMs, or higher studies abroad. No one\'s really thought of starting a company right after college. When I tell my friends that if I can, I will start a company right after college even though I too have been campus-placed at a reputed firm , most of the reactions are like "but you will work for big co. for sometime, you know, to gain experience, won\'t you?", or simply, "yeah right".

You can't mow five times harder and then not need to mow it for a longer period. The same goes with cleaning.    Something else: I've found that not watching TV has been a huge time gain. We chose not to have cable in our house. If I accidentally play a computer game for 3 hours, instead of one, it's no big deal. When we do watch TV, we watch DVDs of series that have been pre-filtered by our friends. [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] I discussed Paul Graham\'s work with a friend recently. He said that he\'s worried that Paul Graham is so popular now that even if he wrote crap, that some people would like it, just because it was him that wrote it.    This is a very real concern, as I\'ve seen it happen to others. I think it\'s good that Paul Graham always has friends review his writing, because they probably give a more accurate measure of quality in his work than the overall group of readers.    I personally found this latest article very interesting, since I suffer from the problem of procrastinating work on hard problems.

aS'[SOC] This essay is right on the mark. I can\'t even count the number of times a day I feel pangs of guilt for not doing what I should be doing...and I\'m working 100+ hours a week in a fledgling two-man startup.    Those three types of procrastination are not the only ones I find, however. Like bugs in programming, there can be compound procrastination too. Sometime\'s I find myself procrastinating from working on a hard problem by reading Reddit or Slashdot...but in reality the reason I\'m reading is so that I don\'t feel guilty about not doing chores and can have more time to do real work.    Perhaps my extremes are a special case, however. In my freshman year of high school, when a particularly stern teacher stated flatly that no essay would be accepted late unless someone was suffering from a serious illness. I was bold enough to raise my hand and patiently wait to ask the question, "is procrastination a serious illness?"    I\'m still not sure if I was really kidding. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] I find that the least productivity-damaging way to deal with errands is to put all of them off until some one errand can no longer wait, and then do them all at once.  In other words, apply a greedy algorithm to the fewest-interruptions problem. Sometimes, if most of the errands are sufficiently mindless, they become a type-C-productive block of time in themselves because while I'm doing them I can still mull over hard problems in the back of my mind.

p276
aS"[SOC] my experience is probably atypical, but I think 2 startups came out of the class I was in-one dotcom, and a biometrics integrator.    It would be interesting to have an entrepreneurship class that was graded solely on the basis of a final project, and which had a required application for admission.  Other than the fact that the students would still have other classes to do and that they would be drawn from a single university, it sounds similar to SFP.   modulo  diff Y-comb teacher     This would seem to be a step along the vector from normal angel investors to Y-combinator: you lower the cost of entry for the would-be entrepreneurs and give up some control.  As you lower barriers to entry into anything, you will tend to get a worse average but a better leadergroup.  Actually, that is not quite true-when you lower  i uniform /i  barriers to entry, that is the case.  When nonuniform barriers to entry are lowered, the average might go up too.      The university need not give the kids enough to live on-they already have dorms, etc..  Further, the universities need not get ANY of the company to make it worth their effort-they could take 1% of the company and give it to the instructors or something as part of the terms of the class, and thus guarantee that this class had the pick of the instructors, but they have no additional cost and hence no need to profit.  If the class was given over the summer semester, then it would get REALLY cheap for the colleges-they have excess housing for the summer anyway.  So other than their cluelessness, why don't the very best colleges do their own in-house Y-combs?  I bet Olin Shivers would do such a class, as would Robert Dewar at NYU, and Greenspun at MIT. [EOC]"

I saw this pattern in a number  of other hackers. [EOC]"

He entertain's me, and the reddit crowd seem to like him but nobody else has ever heard of him for heavens sake.    Procrastination, yeah. Well I tried not mowing the lawn. Turns out the neighbours would rather complain while pushing thier own mower over it than they would knock on my door and ask me to mow it myself.    Not that I own a mower or anything. Stupid bit of grass. I wanna pave it over with a giant chessboard really, but I can't afford it. [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] I don't know what to make of OCaml's claims about having near-C++ performance: some say it's only for code that looks like C++ code. Still interesting.

In that case, if the code looks like C++ sometimes  or lots of times , at least you can forget about memory management while still getting performance close to or better than C++. [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] I use backpack a lot, it is great. But it is not google speed at all. But because of great design, and clever use of ajax tricks, it is more then usable.    I am worried that the good work that rails does in the development side may not extend to complex nasty real world deployments, mostly due to the fact that the rails crowd seems to want to do their own thing, and not use other platforms/tricks that people learned a long time ago.    I may be old an cynical, but there seems an arrogance of youth around rails at the moment, an attitude that they know best and most past technologies were done by idiots. Time will show this as incorrect, at least partially.     [EOC]'
p316
aS"[SOC] Michael: My gut feelings kinda agrees with you but I don't actually know that much about these issues.  Do you have specific suggestions about deployment/platforms/tricks for more complicated environments? [EOC]"
p317
aS'[SOC] No not really. Part of the reason things like J2EE got into such a mess was a concept of partitions roles: developers being just one part of the food chain.     In reality, a lot of the world is domainated by sysadmins, and J2EE and its ilk was a lot about giving deployment options back to them. Java itself does this by making the binaries cross platform, so the platform can change at the sysadmins whim.    In some ways rails is back to the future in this regard. I think peter yared  active grid  is talking up the fact that linux is everywhere, and therefor linux is the platform, so maybe it is ultimately a non issue. But not in my8 world yet.    As for rails, I think there are a few tools out there. I guess the trick is to automate it. Automate, automate, and then automate again. Ideally you will just run one command to deploy, one to undo that deployment if it all goes wrong.    But it will take time to mature I believe. [EOC]'

p332
aS'[SOC] The author\'s hypothesis is that Python is not growing towards Lisp, and that it shouldn\'t. The former is undoubtedly true, the latter will always be up for debate. No one can agree on the terms of the debate, though, so it will likely remain an unproductive argument.    Prescod makes several unsubstantiated claims, in particular that an object is a "better" abstraction than a function, and that programmers do not like deeply nested expressions. The former statement strikes me as meaningless: some will program just as well with functions as others will with objects. The latter observation hints at the strange element of Lisp syntax that differentiates it from other programming languages: deeply-nested expressions.      Most other languages don\'t have as many parentheses. Most other languages do not use prefix syntax. Glancing over a sheet of Lisp code and a sheet of Python code, what will strike you most is the difference in indentation. The Python code will have several more sections of statements at the same indentation level.    Prescod claims that most programmers prefer this type of indentation. Of course, he has no data to back up this claim. I suspect that most programmers do like Python indentation more than they like Lisp indentation. The comparison is unfair, however, since most hackers start programming in a language other than Lisp. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] it wouldn't have to cover every possible idea, just cater to every actual person who didn't care enough to specifically opt out of it.    my background here is from growing up in a country with pretty much that kind of a state religion; 90-plus percent of the population were members of the church, and almost everybody ignored it. the church offended nobody, and happily took in the vast majority of those people who actually wanted to be religious; they defaulted into the state church, which was mostly harmless since it didn't want to  and politically couldn't afford to  offend anybody.    the only people who opted out of the church were people who wanted to join a nutball-fringe sect of some kind or other, and a vanishingly small fraction of atheists even stauncher than i. there was no need to, for anybody else. in other words, opting out of the state church could be used as a handy signal of unreasonable fanaticism or some other kind of intellectual weirdness.

I look at the python entry and see that it does not do closures well, for whatever that is worth to me.  A less trivial thing is that he equates novices with dufuses.  There is a very big difference between the two, and designing for the two groups is very different. [EOC]'

p350
aS"[SOC] Paul covers a lot of ground in this essay.  A good deal of economics and development theory and history.  A great many minds have spent a lot of time on these topics and I think overall they haven't found the answers to be as simple as Paul makes them out to be.  I am not one of these scholars so I won't make the definitive critique but I can think of a few points:    Families need stability as well as economic growth.  Paul's formula provides no way to even try to find the right balance.    A tremendous amount of wealth is created by government funded research.  Think of all the medical research and the military funding of ARPA and missile programs  and transistors .  Paul's analysis has no good way to account for that.    There is a tremendous amount of wealth being create by the free/open source movement that cannot be accounted for by Paul's analysis.  The FOSS seems to be populated by socialist utopians from a bygone era.  Richard Stallman is a leftist of some kind and Linus Torvalds is from Finland, a  i relatively /i  socialistic country.    It is not really possible to prove why the industrial revolution happened where it did.  You can make reasoned arguments, but that's not the same thing.    We need to explain why ancient Greek was able to create so much mathematics without any entrepreneurs.    In the age of nuclear weapons and genetic engineering we still need to be able to rein in some kinds of research. No entrepreneur will do that.  Unless one invents something...    Change introduces instability and the danger of this is neither predictable nor controllable.  There is undeniable risk.    It isn't that so much of what Paul said was wrong is that there is so much else that needs to be explained and that none of it can be proven.    It must also be said that if it were not for the entrepreneurs not only would I not have a career but I would probably not be alive.  I'm not denying the positive side -- I'm saying the analysis Paul gives is just not enough.  It's version 0.1, not version 5.1.     [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] I am a successful entrepreneur and I was exactly the kind of procrastinator Paul Graham talks about. I have an extremely sharp sense of what's important in order to succeed at my goal, and I tend to only do that.    However this has caused me a lot of problems:    - I postponed washing my chlotes and buying new ones until I was almost in rags    - I procrastinated on doing accounting, so I had to dissolve my first company because the accounting was a disaster, and had to start a new one just for this reason. I don't know if this is usual in your country but in mine it is.    - I procrastinated on cleaning. My house used to be a rat's paradise.    The end result is the fact that my lifestyle sucked. I had lots of stress, I was always afraid something bad will happen because of my sharp focus on what's important.    Then I decided to change. My current approach is that even if I have something important to do, such as interviewing and hiring a new developer, some things such as accounting, taking a shower, etc - always have #1 priority. I get these done as quickly and as efficiently as possible and then move on to what's really important.    Since I took this decision my life is a lot better. I wear clean chlotes and I don't live in fear that an accounting audit will come and fine me a lot.    Paul Graham has a point in his article. However, if applied verbatim, his advice will lead to a lot of stress and a bad life. [EOC]"

If you develop for Linux, you support Linux and help Linux be more popular.    If you develop for Windows, you support Windows and help Windows be more popular.    Who profits from Windows? Microsoft. A company which at least pay a lot of programmers to work on Windows.    Who profits from Linux? IBM, Red Hat, HP, and other companies who take the Linux source for free, make profit, and most of the time don't pay a dime to Linux developers.    So I think that if you care about your fellow programmers, you should work on Windows programs and promote Windows. [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] There are good cases to make for putting the tools to create syntactic abstractions into the hands of programmers. However, this guy fails, and he fails miserably. What enables him to pull his example off is call/cc, not macros. You can implement generators just as gracefully in a macroless language with call/cc, such as Ruby.    In fact, when I first wrote a generators implementation in Scheme it didn't even occur to me to use macros; macros are great, but they should almost never be considered until procedural abstraction has been determined inadequate.

Living in Rome, Italy, I'm kind of...out of the loop on some  most  of America's popular fixes/icons of the moment.  Hence, I don't know anything about Paul Graham...    But none of this takes away from the very plain, very obvious fact that GOOD AND BAD PROCRASTINATION is extremely well-written.  And if PG has the insight to choose his friends to proofread his essays  as do I for mine because they all happen to be smarter than I am!! , then all the better.    Hats off to you Mr. Graham!

aS"[SOC] When I'm working on a hard problem and I figure something out, I stop. I should just write the code, but I 'reward' myself by taking a break, or having lunch or running an errand content that I know how to solve the problem. When it comes time to implement the solution, it's no longer an interesting problem so it becomes a chore...which is exactly what I need when I hit the next brick wall. And so it proceeds. The path between me and my goals is a roller coaster. And a to do list is not a good leveling algorithm. [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] I\'d like to make 3 points about Paul\'s essay:    1  Just because someone is able to focus on some "great project", I don\'t see that, in itself, as having merit. It depends on what the outcome of the project is. Adolf Hitler was deloused at the expense of the state in 1908 and was effectively destitute at that time. However, he rose to great power following WWI. There wasn\'t a lot of procrastination as he strove towards his big project\'s goal. In short, there\'s a moral aspect to what we work on.    2  "Are you working on the most important problems in your field?". Having spent many years in scientific research myself, I have to ask the question: "who decides what the important problems are?". Thomas Gold was right on the money for some problems that weren\'t even on the radar screens of his peers! Of course, he also had some spectacular misses; but my point is that few institutions tolerate men like Thomas Gold.    3  Many artists  and I include mathematicians, scientists and business people here too , successful or otherwise, are so self absorbed with themselves I find them both boring and fairly shitty people to work with, or just to be around them. Personally see some merit in, say, someone who puts the needs of his or her children first - in effect, making them "Project 1". Nor do I see it as inevitable that if you do so, that you cannot also be successful in other areas of your life.    That said, I very much enjoyed Paul\'s essay as it put some of the main issues of procrastination into stark contast.    Andrew Sheppard [EOC]'

People who aren't so lucky are faced with the unenviable situation of:    1  Having to decide what language to use, despite not being very well versed in the field.    2  Being stuck with the choice they made because even that one language was difficult to learn.

aS"[SOC] In your example, the users of your COUNTER procedure now need to know that in order to make a counter, they need to call MAKE-GENERATOR. That's an ugly exposure of implementation detail. What happens when you re-write COUNTER using closures to preserve state?    Well then maybe the person who wrote COUNTER should create a procedure like MAKE-COUNTER, which calls MAKE-GENERATOR for the user. But then everyone who writes a generator needs to write a constructor procedure.     Hmm.    How could we solve this problem? A macro perhaps?     [EOC]"

p413
aS'[SOC] It\'s not an ugly exposure of implementation detail any more than, say, all Python methods receiving an _explicit_ rather than _implicit_ \'self\' parameter is. In other words, I think it is a completely valid design decision; the scoping is out in the open.     I don\'t understand your second objection. Post some code if you want to make it clearer.    Edit: Okay, I think I see what your objection is now. With my implementation, make-counter would be defined as     define  make-counter n      make-generator counter n      How exactly is this tedious or in dire need of macrology? Keep in mind that there _is_ a conceptual distinction between the "guts" of a generator and the constructor of a generator. Unfortunately Python muddies the waters because of how procedures magically become generators as soon as you use the yield statement; I think following its footsteps in this matter would be a bad idea.    You could factor out the details into a higher-order function, if you were so inclined:     define  maker gen-proc      lambda args  apply make-generator  cons gen-proc args         define make-counter  maker counter       define c10  make-counter 10      Look ma, no macros!

aS'[SOC] How often would you want to expose the implementation details of COUNTER? Almost never. So why do you want a programmer who writes a generator to almost always define a constructor procedure?    In a few hours I created a generator facility that feels at least as "baked-in" as Python\'s. That wouldn\'t be possible without a little macro magic. Is there a better interface for generators? Are generators a good idea? Is there a better abstraction for solving these sorts of problems? I\'m glad I use a language that allows other people to easily explore these questions. [EOC]'
p416
aS'[SOC] This is exactly the case for me, as well!  Even though I\'m drawn to the hardest problem in the group of things to do, I find that things work much better if I use "working on the hard problem" *as* the reward for having cleared out the smaller ones that I\'d otherwise not fiinish.   Then, if things go well, when I finally get around to the interesting problem, I have nothing more interesting still to do than implement it once I\'ve solved it. [EOC]'

"In a few hours I created a generator facility that feels at least as "baked-in" as Python\'s."    Have you considered that making them feel as baked-in as Python\'s is not really appropriate? That\'s what my "muddying the waters" comment was trying to suggest.    Here\'s a macro I wrote that makes creation of bindings more Python-like.

I\'m glad I use a language that allows other people to easily explore these questions."    I just wanted to say that I agree with this. However, you have to exercise care when designing macros that are used together with existing language constructs. Hidden parameters and the like break the user\'s expectation of Scheme\'s scoping mechanism, and should only be done if the alternative is way too inconvenient. If you are designing embedded DSLs using macros, the rules are totally different, of course.    Also, even if you take the macro route, it is considered good style to factor out as much as possible into functions to keep the macro definition minimal.    In your article you also mention that it\'s kind of inconvenient to have to specify \'yield\' as a parameter to define-generator. If you are going for the baked-in feel, you can get around this by using non-hygienic macros, e.g. syntax-case macros  which most good Scheme systems support . [EOC]'
p422
aS'[SOC] What I find interesting about Graham\'s essays is that he so often approaches what are conventionally considered "business" or "humanistic" problems and approaches them from the point of view of a programmer who has a fair amount of business and life experience. The insights are almost always worth my reading.  I\'m a folklorist who has begun to think and write about similar topics starting from the humanistic perspective -- the dearth of interesting work by humanists on technology is just surprising. I\'m a little, okay a lot, embarrassed for the academy.     I come to reddit from reading Graham\'s essays -- and thanks to Slashdot for first turning me onto Graham! And I\'m glad I clicked on the "comment" link, because I think a lot of people have raised important qualifications to Graham\'s schema. Most of these qualifications point out that all those B-level operations still must get done. The fallouts are:     * Individuals who do only C and never B tasks in fact defer those tasks to others. This is possible in a work environment where there is a staff to handle those B tasks -- which is an interesting conundrum given Graham\'s argument that staff hired to handle B tasks often in fact interrupt those who work on the C tasks and hired them in the first place in order to defer the B tasks. In a home environment, B task deferment falls to a partner, whom you can only hope doesn\'t have C tasks of their own -- I know a lot of successful academics, mostly men, who have very  *very*  patient  and forgiving and a lot of other things  wives that tend to all the B tasks.    * Individuals who only focus on C tasks, while perhaps achieving some level of greatness  and/or recognition , are often individuals who are out of balance. They are, to put it less politely than some of the commentators here have, assholes.  Again, my experience in the academy gives me plenty of examples to call upon.  So, while we may admire their achievements, it\'s often the case  not always  that we also recognize that they are miserable human beings, and plenty of people choose a "more mediocre" life but one of relative happiness  however you want to define the latter term .    * Sometimes A and B tasks are integral to getting C tasks done. As several posters put it, sometimes doing something else is a way of working on the C task you were "supposed" to be working on all along. Both the poet Wallace Stevens and the linguist Edward Sapir -- one an accountant and the other an insurance underwriter by occupation -- are reported to have gotten their best work done during long walks. So, C taskers who were occupied by B tasks who got their C tasks done while doing A tasks.     Finally, my comment beyond my summary above is that the comments I read actually, many of which were by their own admission done as A or B level procrastination, actually made the composite essay a better one, which was one of Tim Berners-Lee\'s desires for the web in the first place. So my thanks to everyone for allowing me time and place to read and to think a little bit this morning while I gear up to do my own work. [EOC]'
p423
aS"[SOC] Maybe I'm an idiot.  Certainly I am a Lisp beginner who doesn't know jack about continuations or call/cc.  What I have to ask, given this state of ignorance, is why a generator needs continuations?  Wouldn't it be sufficent to create a function taking a number, which returns a function that increments and returns the number, and isn't this entirely possible and quite transparent using lexical closures?  Like I said, I'm a terrible beginner at Lisp, but I think there's even an example like this in my textbook... [EOC]"
p424
aS"[SOC] In the counter example that would be sufficient, yes. In general, generators are closely related to streams. However, once you have something more complicated such as     define  walk-tree yield tree        unless  null? tree          walk-tree yield  tree-left tree           yield  tree-data tree           walk-tree yield  tree-right tree        your approach becomes more complicated to use: you end up having to write the code at the 'yield' boundaries in continuation-passing form.

He gave the 2003 remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' the same rating  0 stars , for mainly the same reasons:     http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031017/REVIEWS/310170308/1023    Maybe 'Wolf Creek' is really bad, maybe not. I respect Roger a lot - he seems to have grown to dislike gratuitously sadistic movies, which is fine. However, contrast this with the 3.5 stars he gave 'Last House on the Left', for example:    http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19720101/REVIEWS/201010318/1023    Granted that was a long time ago  1972 , but I can't deny how disturbing that movie was. I'll be curious to see if he reviews 'Hostel', which appears to have a similar theme to 'Wolf Creek', only set in Eastern Europe.    Not to put too fine a point on it, but here's a little more perspective on where Roger stood on a few other violent/disturbing movies that leap to mind:    'Saw'  2 stars : http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041028/REVIEWS/40923005/1023    'The Devil's Rejects'  3 stars : http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050721/REVIEWS/50712001/1023    'The Passion of the Christ'  4 stars : http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040224/REVIEWS/402240301/1023    'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  1974 original   2 stars : http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19740101/REVIEWS/401010319    Whatever.

aS'[SOC] I have read quite a few of Paul Graham\'s essays and I have also read his book "Hackers and Painters". I have to say that I agree with most of what he writes.     The problem with the procrastination essay is that it seems to assume that most of us live in a world where we can choose what to do. I would love to work on the "big problems" in my field. I am not afraid to tackle difficult problems. The way the world works today however, it seems that only projects that have early returns are viable. If you have a lot of money and you can work on whatever you want without worrying about money, then the essay is right on. But in the real world, if you want to work on a project you have to get funding. Good luck getting funding for a "big project" that promises results in 10 or more years! The ones giving you the money always want results every few months. You are forced to work on small problems just to prove that you are making progress. Even in academia, you have to work on small problems so that you can write a lot of papers. People seem to think that it\'s better if someone has written 30 "small project" papers than if he has written one "large project" paper.    It would be great if we could work on big projects, but the way corporations and academia work today, you cannot do that. You are forced to work on small projects to get results quickly in order to satisfy the ones giving you the money. [EOC]'

p443
aS'[SOC] Point taken. If I had to discern from the reviews which movie he hated more, it would appear to be \'Wolf Creek\' by a slight margin. I guess I\'m guilty of inferring that he thought TCM was over the line, even though he didn\'t actually say it.    I\'m not trying to argue any point - I just find it interesting to observe Roger as he occasionally puts adds a movie to that "over the line" category. The movie \'Chaos\' that samf pointed out is another example; actually a much better example than TCM.    I\'ll probably rent \'Wolf Creek\' sometime in the future, just to see if I agree with Roger. I have a feeling I will. That\'s the funny thing about movies made just to shock. They\'ll have made a buck off of me just because I wanted to see how depraved it was, even though I knew going in I probably would not have liked it.    For what it\'s worth, I thought the TCM remake was pretty weak overall. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] I think Paul doesn\'t get the whole truth here. While Web 2.0 is clearly a buzzword, it makes sense to analyze what the new breed of web apps have in common and is better than before. It is not just Ajax, democracy and be nice to users. One thing is he misses the APIs, but I think there is a better way to describe the difference.    Initially Web was about getting something out there that the whole world can use. There is one to many relationship between your site and its users. Economically the difference from old businesses is that your front desk cost now is easily available for anyone, and its cost is pretty much constant as the users grow. Your front desk is your site.    Web 2.0 is about using the network effects in your site. The more your site is used, the more beneficial it is for its users. Your site is not just a connection between you and your users, it is many-to-many connection between your users.     It is a lot like bringing network effects like the ones we know from instant messaging on a new platform - the Web. Why is the Web suitable for this? Because there are already acccumulated solid and general mechanisms that make the web work, and you can plug in yours more easily. If you use things like RSS, REST, JSON, etc it is also easier for others to plug in to you. This is how mashups come into play.    This is a lot like a preexposed and generalized democracy component. Being nice to users is necessary in the context of democracy, because in such environment minor usability enhancements have compound effect to the bottom line: that\'s why Ajax is necessary. Now that extra effort to make the site a little more useful is actually worth it. You need to enable users to be effective in your democracy, because this affects the bottom line. You need to be easily reachable, which accounts for APIs, bookmarklets, backlink tracking etc.    But I think democracy is a misnomer: political democracy is about voting, and have the majority win. Minority doesn\'t get what it wants. It is quite a different mechanism that works with The Long Tail: everyone should get what is suitable for him. Most Web 2.0 applications are not quite there, but clearly this is the trend.    P.S: It is an interesting thought experiment to imagine implementing a Long Tail kind of democracy politically. Neal Stephenson envisions a world of small districts with radically different laws in "Snow Crash". But it is not necessary to divide the laws by land  so that you must obey different laws depending on your location . You may have rights, obligations and access to public services depending on a set of laws you choose to be yours  e.g. an important citeria would be the taxes you have to pay . There are numerious problems with this, of course. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] 1 3   The point of the essay wasn't to say that focusing on a great project is a good thing to do.  Instead, he was explaining something about procrastination as it relates to working on a great project.  It also didn't say that someone who completes a great project is a good person, or even a successful one.  A general theme of Paul's writing is great projects and how to succeed at working on one.      2   The question wasn't saying that you should conform to what your peers think important questions are.  It meant more that, if you believe that what you're working on is less important than something else you could be working on, you should be working on the more important thing.  Thomas Gold probably thought what he was working on was one of the most important problems in his field, even if his peers didn't.  Also, Paul's essay is more focused inward, at how you can improve your own progress on great projects, not that you should try to convince others to do the same. [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] man!  Based on the comments I\'ve read above mine, I think this must be the most content-rich web discussion forum I\'ve ever encountered!  What is the reddit secret?  Why so many more smart participants than, say, slashdot?    anyway.  I\'d just like to add that I\'ve been reading Paul\'s essays for years now, and they\'ve almost all been uniformly great. I can\'t even remember where I first encountered him.  I sent him an e-mail a few months ago, and he answered it, even though I\'m sure he gets hundreds of e-mails per day.  I\'ve been trying to think up a second e-mail topic that might be interesting enough to garner another reply, but I haven\'t yet.    Those of you talking about exceptions to his putting-off-errands message are, perhaps, missing relevant experience to understand what he\'s talking about.  Someone said he had to put off A tasks such as interviewing programmers, for example, to do B-level errands.  I\'m pretty sure that\'s not what Paul is talking about.    There are some types of work that are almost infinitely hard.  You can only work on such problems in long, uninterrupted stretches of time, and only when properly inspired.  Certain types of computer programming are that hard for me.  If I found myself in a mood to tackle one of those hard problems, then yeah, I would absolutely put off laundry, changing the oil in my car, paying the bills, or anything else to put the work behind me.  If your field doesn\'t require that sort of work from you, I guess I envy you a little bit, because it\'s really draining.  If so, you are perhaps not someone that Paul\'s essay applies to.    If you guys like Paul Graham, you\'re also liable to like John McCarthy, the inventor of lisp.  I recently ran across this story he wrote which I found very enlightening, "The Robot and the Baby."    http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/robotandbaby.html    Truly excellent in all technical aspects, but it also demonstrates that understanding human beings is perhaps not McCarthy\'s strong suit.  Heh! [EOC]'

p486
aS"[SOC] Well, chu, according to at least 28 people, this was worth reading and promoting.    Anyway, the funny thing about his site is I think it fits the concept well. It is extremely useable and is simple - much like Reddit.    Listening to users will get you the likes of Digg, which while not the ugliest website ever, is not nearly as intuitive as Reddit nor is it very original. It just looks like a bad Mozilla clone  which isn't suprising considering that the designers of the Mozilla site did Digg .    There was a time when Digg was a lot simpler and more useable, but they went for beauty over simplicity, and consequently lost both attributes. [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] It's even funny that someone cares to post a blog about how java *presumably* won't go anywhere soon. It's not something to presume, it's something obvious. Java is pretty strong in the web development field, and  it will remain so. If you care to choose the right tools, it's a joy, and miles ahead of Rails.   I say this not as a Java fanboy, but as someone with something more than visions of a massive migration from J2EE to Rails. [EOC]"
p491
aS"[SOC] Exactly. My original programs and the Lisp and Scheme translations are all available on our site and you can redo the benchmark yourself to verify the results.

Also, check out Juho Snellman's optimised Lisp implementation that uses a macro to help with unboxing, greatly improving performance under SBCL.    Cheers,  Jon Harrop.   [EOC]"
p492
aS'[SOC] From my view, the article over-emphasizes the "making" part of wealth creation and under-emphasizes the selling. It\'s a two-part process. You make the stuff and you sell it. Then the wealth flows.     It\'s not enough just to have users. You need to actually sell your product. Alternatively you can aim to be bought out by a larger firm. In which case, you\'re working in partnership with the larger firm and they\'re handling the all-important selling part. You\'re supplying ready-made burgers to McDonalds, who are paying you 20 cents a burger and charging $4 to the public.     Whoever handles the sales component of the wealth creation, typically recoups 90% of the reward. Control the customer interface and you call the shots.   [EOC]'

I originally used only LOC but, after much objection from the Lisp and Scheme communities, I also tried chars, words, tokens and so on.

p498
aS"[SOC] The modalities of procrastination came as no shock to me, I'd figured that out long ago. What resonated with me was the part about interruptions.    I very recently quit a fairly decent job of 7 years because my idiot boss never grokked the idea  no matter how many times he claimed to understand  there's a relationship between phoning me 20  !  times a day and asking why his secure financial system isn't ready yet. For a while I tried working in the wee hours of the morning and answering his stupid phone calls all day. I'd like my life back, so I quit. Now, frankly it'll never get done. Not my problem any more.    I envy people that can get paid to work without having to concentrate for hours or have long complicated setups and teardowns.

aS'[SOC] The article  and some of its comments  go over-the-top in their praise of physical books, but I have to admit that I share a lot of their feelings.    And, yes, I admit it --- I\'m a new-book-sniffer. :     *The Complete Calvin and Hobbes* is probably being the most recent "nice book" that I\'ve run across. I really like the binding and the simplicity of the covers, and I like the not-quite-white artist\'s paper it\'s printed on. It\'s a really awesome book  set of books, rather .    OTOH, one of the great pleasures of electronic books is that you can have *so many*. If I rub my hands in glee after finding a good book, I also rub my hands in glee when stumbing onto an archive of hundreds of thousands of books that I can download at leisure.    And you can search the text of electronic books, which is nice. I prefer an electronic dictionary to a physical one  though I do have both . [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] In Europe it is not that uncommon for a woman to skip a period from time to time by just continuing their contraceptive intake. In Europe contraceptive pills are provided in 21 pill packs and you stop taking them for 7 days rather than using a placebo which, from the article, appears to be the case in the US. So it is relatively easy to just go on to the next pack. Likewise users of the oestrogen only so called "mini-pill" usually take these 28 days a cycle and have reduced or no period as a result.

No explanation? Skill comes with practice, seems pretty simple. Both of my  B.A.  housemates have read approximately 1 book in the past year.    Maybe the deeper cause is that more students are attending university, so you get a increasingly wider range of students, so you get more who don\'t like to read, which brings down the average.

Suddenly, music can be distributed without any physical constraints and the market doesn\'t rely on pushing superstars everywhere to everybody.

aS'[SOC] When I was a college sophomore I suffereed through an alcohol-awareness forum imposed on the students by the school administration.  Someone had conducted a survey on binge drinking and found that half the student had been on a bender in a two week period.  Their standard for "binge drinking" was three drinks in two hours: pathetically low.  My sense is that something similar is going on with this article.  Maybe there are new trends emerging in overall American literacy, and maybe not  this IS just one study, in a pretty soft field .  The WaPo does us a disservice by publishing the results under a headline that implicitly reads: "Literacy of College Graduates Is On Decline:  Civilization is Doomed." [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] Glad to see someone thought my post was worth reading, although it was written 18 months ago.    Yes, my blog post has plenty of bad writting and errors.  Part of the reason I write blogs is to help with my writting skills, and you can see that I need it : .    But, when publishing a book, I could easily contract out that work, and save myself lots of money.  And it wouldn't be anything near the 20% pdxmph suggests.  Both proofreaders and tech reviewers are about $1000 each.  If you only sold 1000 books, that $1 per book for each service, which is nowhere near the 20% of a $49.99 book.    Since the time I wrote this post, I've been contacted by a couple authors that self-published, and not one has lost money.  Granted, none of these books sold anywhere near 10 thousand copies, but most tech books barely sell more then 2500 copies.  They all made more then what the major publishers where willing to give them as an advance  which most authors know that is all they will ever see . [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] I wasn\'t trying to say the proofreading and copyediting cost 20 percent of the endeavor ... I was discussing the notion that rather than being willing to pay a 40 percent premium for a self-published book  strictly comparing page counts and prices, which I know isn\'t exactly scientific , I\'d be more inclined to deduct 20 percent from the going price of a  book comparable in scope and content by a Wrox or O\'Reilly if I had reason to believe that book wasn\'t the recipient of professional editorial services.    Speaking as a sometime development editor with a major publishing house, I\'m all in favor of a more stringent editorial process managed by people who are able to say "no" to self-indulgent and cocky authors. I\'ve seldom had an adversarial relationship with an author, but I\'ve had a few run-ins that taught me the value of someone with real distance from the work and some control over cutting the checks having a hand in the process.    Speaking as a published author, I preferred going with the publishing house because it let me put the book down when I was done with it, collect my check, and move on to my next project with no accounting, marketing or other worries.

I don\'t wanna give most of the profit to some fatass loser producer or some nerdy pimple ridden dude at the sales counter, because BOTH OF THEM KNOW LESS ABOUT THE PRODUCT I\'M TRYING TO BUY THAN I DO! And besides that, if theirs a problem with my product and i try to return it, their the a$$holes who won\'t fix my problem or replace my item!!    If i go and buy something direct from the person who made it, they get most of the profit, they know all about the product  so will be able to answer all of my questions  and if i have a problem with the product, they will take care of it for me and i won\'t have to beg and plead.    This creates consumer confidence and i would return to buy stuff from them even if i didn\'t really need it.    and F$#@ anyone who only see\'s the bottom dollar and can\'t see the bigger picture! and F#$@ you if u don\'t beleive that the consumers happiness is the most important factor in this whole process.

aS'[SOC] I\'m not a fan of Best Buy by any means ...    but I have to agree with jedberg ... it seems that if there was a real emergency because nature was calling, the "intellectual" could have just asked the cashier to get him verified and out the door quickly.    But instead, the author deliberately escalated the situation.    Maybe its just me, but I haven\'t been to an electronics store lately that did not check your receipt on the way out ... unless it was a mom and pop operation in a good part of town.    These kinds of situations can easily get out of hand if it kept escalating ... leading to damage, injured persons, or worse if somebody involved had a gun. The Best Buy guy followed the author out to his car - big mistake. Both sides in the dispute were escalating ... a recipe for disaster.    Don\'t try this at any shady camera shops in Manhattan. [EOC]'
p587
aS'[SOC] Meh; whether you\'re being "an ass" or not, the law\'s on the consumer\'s side  oddly enough . If you pay for membership at a store, like at a Sam\'s Club or a Costco, they can make "must stop at door for receipt inspection" a condition of membership. That\'s about it.    A store anyone can shop at can\'t stop you at the door to check your receipt. They can ask you to stop, but they can\'t actually physically stop you.    I agree completely with the author\'s position -- if I pay for something, I\'m done. I have no need for security cronies following me demanding I prove I\'ve paid for it. "Guilty until innocent" doesn\'t fly with me. Prove I stole something from you.    Had I been in a similar position, the moment brute force  or the threat of such  was used to physically stop me from leaving, I\'d have offered a single warning to move away from me and clear my vehicle\'s path  inviting them to record my license plate but warning that a car weighs a *lot* more than a human . Then, if they\'d refused, I\'d have called the police myself, and pushed as hard as I could to have charges filed against everyone involved.    If this really happened the way the author describes, the security minions at the store had already made so many mistakes in their handling of the situation that even if he *had* stolen the stuff, they\'d have had major trouble getting charges to stick. It\'s fine to follow the guy out to his car to ask him to return to the store. Everything that happened afterwards *isn\'t*. Using your body to prevent a person from entering their car to leave is a form of detainment  unlawful at that . Using your body to block the vehicle\'s departure is similarly detainment.    The author really should have involved the police as soon as he saw the situation escalating. I, too, have shopped at stores that want to inspect my receipt at the exit. I\'ve thanked them for their interest and walked past them without "presenting my papers" every single time. We do not  yet  live in a society where we\'re guilty until we prove we\'re not, and I refuse to submit to little power trips like that.    Incidentally, you can still return something to a store that "marks" receipts they inspect at the door even without the little "inspection mark."    This probably sounds nasty, but here\'s the bottom line: shoplifting and theft at stores like this is *not* my problem. I am not part of the problem, and I am not going to be a willing participant in your solution. If your inventory system is so broken that you really *do* have to count stuff sold as it goes out the door, upgrade your inventory system. If you have a rampant shoplifting problem, take effective steps to make identification and prosecution of thieves easier. You discourage theft by making it unprofitable and personally destructive to the thieves, not by inconveniencing and annoying your customers.    Hassling people at the door is almost *never* successful and usually at least annoys people  and in this case, it was much worse , and when you try it with someone who actually knows their rights, you get incidents like this. While those goons were chasing after a paying customer, countless others walked out the front doors without a glance from the "security" guy who\'s supposed to be pouncing people at the door for their receipts. You can\'t show whether that let another thief out the door, but the customer the goons chased down turned right back around, and whipped out that receipt not for "proof of purchase" but for "I want a refund, *now*" purposes.    The store lost a sale because of its behavior *after* it\'d made the sale and the customer was *out the door*. That\'s pretty sad. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] You say "This probably sounds nasty, but here\'s the bottom line: shoplifting and theft at stores like this is not my problem. I am not part of the problem, and I am not going to be a willing participant in your solution."    But thats like saying to the security guy at the airport  "security isn\'t my problem. I\'m not part of the problem. So\'m I\'m just going to mosey on through and take my seat."    You might be right, and you\'re living by your principles,  but you could be dead too. I think staying alive is the wisest option, unless you\'re really willing to take responsibility for the consequences of your actions.    OK, so maybe thats a little bit dramatic and over the top, but you have to ask yourself "is this really worth getting into an argument over? am I willing to pay the consequeces? How far will I go if they step it up a notch ?"    In many situations, the wrong answer to that question will result in even bigger problems, even if you\'re "right".    Stand up for the things you believe in, but choose your battles wisely. [EOC]'

Do you understand how broken that is?    I didn\'t say I\'d walk through an airport security checkpoint like that, did I? Besides, I\'ve never had trouble with a security minion at an airport such that I felt the need to get lippy  that is, I\'ve stood in line, walked through their magic scanner, and gone on my way -- if they ever do stop me for a more thorough search, I will ask many questions and I *will* stand up for myself, but not in a threatening or "scene-making" way .    I\'m *not* part of the shoplifting problem, because I don\'t shoplift. I have no interest in participating in their little games to protect their merchandise. I\'m not really a part of the airport security problem either, but there\'s a different way to protest that kind of thing  believe it or not, people actually do "stand up for themselves" -- weird, eh?     Your logic that "you may be right but you\'ll just get screwed" is exactly how people like you surrender your freedom and liberty.    And yes, I\'m always ready and willing to take responsibility for my actions. What makes me different from a lot of people is I tend to hold *others* responsible for *their* actions, too. You just try to stop me to inspect my receipt on my way out the door. You\'ll get a polite but firm reminder of where your job ends and bullying begins. Try to physically stop me. G\'wan. Please. It\'ll be fun laying you out in front of your employer and fellow coworkers. And the resulting lawsuit for unlawful detainment will buy a nice house or three. :  [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] If you actually believe that article in BusinessWeek, then you\'re just as misinformed as you were when you wrote this:    "So far, Java seems like a stinker to me. I\'ve never written a Java program, never more than glanced over reference books about it, but I have a hunch that it won\'t be a very successful language."    How can you make a claim that Java isn\'t a successful language? You\'re going to back "Java\'s cover" by citing an article written in BusinessWeek?  Clearly BW is an authority on programming languages.  Did you even read the article -- the author clearly isn\'t a hacker  certainly not by your standards . If you read the comments at the end of the article, you\'ll see that someone rightfully called him on his distorted view of computer technology:    "Given my reading of this article, I have my doubts that the author even understands the difference between an OS, a server, and a language. It\'s mostly nonsense to an actual programmer. Why does he repeatedly position open source software as an alternative to Java?"    As an example of how inane the BW article is:    "The situation at Merrill Lynch   Co.  MER  in New York is telling. The investment bank runs many of its newer math-heavy applications -- such as options, futures, and derivatives -- using just Linux and the Apache server."    Wow, they do all of that with just Linux and Apache? Apache 1.3 doesn\'t calculate derivatives for me -- I guess I need to upgrade to 2.2. Doesn\'t Merrill have to write any code to do all that math? This question probably didn\'t occur to the author because he *doesn\'t know any better.*    If you want to continue to defend "Java\'s cover," then that\'s fine  there are some worthwhile points in there , but at least do so with some decent evidence. Speaking of which, did you notice these facts in the article:    "In North America, the percentage of developers who use Java as one of their principal programming languages declined to 47.9 in Evans\' fall survey."    "IBM stands by its commitment to Java. Its WebSphere middleware is a multibillion-dollar business that grew 14% last quarter."    47.9% of developers use Java as a principal programming langauge...a multibillion-dollar business built on Java...Hmm, Java isn\'t successful at all, is it?    If anyone deserves an apology here, I think it\'s Java.   [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] I think that gay marriage should be legal and I don\'t have a problem with it. Hey, more freedom for everyone, I say.  blatant disclaimer     But just some notes for discussion:    2  I think that hanging around people who are openly gay makes people more likely to act gay. People tend to act like their peers. I understand there is a strong political motivation against statements like that, but sexuality is such a social and physiologically complex thing --more complex than a simple yes/no physical trait. It seems somehow demeaning, and at best, dishonest, to claim otherwise. I think we can all reasonably agree that social behavior is influenced by our social interactions. That sounds obvious to me.    Simply, acceptable behavior is more expressed. Plus, sexuality doesn\'t seem to be a clean straight/gay division, so I think that a more homosexual-friendly society would give borderline people more options. That is, instead of only being willing to have straight relationships, they would be free to have homosexual ones, too. How is that unreasonable?    3  Marrying a dog or a child or a car is absurd. But this still opens some interesting "why not" questions  for me at least, I\'m a comp sci guy, not a law guy . If marriage is whatever consenting adults agree to, why not polygamy? Why not an 80 year old and a 20 year old  legal but frowned on . Why not a "year free trial" clause? Or a marriage subscription that must be renewed every 90 days? Why not? Interesting stuff...

aS"[SOC] Very nice essay.    One point of further consideration is that the advice in the essay probably does not apply to children.  Children are generally right to explore many things, and not worry too much about whether they are solving the hardest problems that exist, or not.  Any problem that helps them learn, even one other people have already solved, will do.  So the child playing video games instead of working on solving public good problems in economics, or even just learning calculus, probably isn't doing anything wrong.    One parallel is that adults, too, shouldn't worry overly about solving the hardest problems that exist, as long as they are learning and making progress.  Working on the hardest problems a person can is all we can ever ask of him.    I think it's worth considering what other parallels there are and how to unify the theories of how children and adults should look at hard problems and procrastination.

I don\'t think they should feel guilty."     This is quite possible, but I think there may be a complex internalized strife where they are able to chanel the guilt and into the project.  For instance a person may feel guilty about not performing an errand and to further substantiate avoidance of that errand come up with critical questions that may be flung at their work.  An attempt to make the work as watertight as possible, against rebukes for not having performed other tasks, a sort of overcompensation.  Answering these questions then takes the person to the next level of development, one that might not have been achieved without the negative energy that is channeled into constructive  and sometimes obsessive  analysis of ones work.

The applicant that doesn't know at least two languages better than java by the time they're 23 is far worse than someone who had trouble with Scheme at the tender age of 18.    What universities really need to start teaching freshman year is python. It's a wonderful teaching language and incredibly powerful to boot. I'm not slighting Perl, Ruby etc. here...it's just that I've seen how much better python is for teaching than Scheme and Java. Java tends to damage the future ability of potential programmers and Scheme leaves some students who would otherwise be excellent programmers in a couple years contemplating other majors.    I'm a firm believer that ASM, CLisp and C in the third year is the way to seperate the best from the rest ;  [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] No, that\'s not what he\'s saying.    "From each according to his abilities" implies that you should should work as hard as you can, creating things of value for society.  That\'s exactly the sort of work ethic that Russell argues against.    What Russell is saying this:  If there exists a moral obligation to do work, it is to fill the needs of ourselves and others.  However, since the advent of industrialism, the needs  and desires  of society are far less than the amount of value that we create by doing work.  Thus, there is no feasible moral obligation to work as hard as is socially accepted.    Furthermore, Russell argues, overworking ourselves at unpleasant tasks causes unuseful misery.  So, if we all worked less at our "jobs", we\'d be happier and have more time and energy for enjoying ourselves.  This implies that, if morality is focused on increasing the happiness of society, and decreasing its misery, then we have a moral obligation to work less. [EOC]'

This criteria seems to fit too many kids who are killing themselves to please their parents and professors - they don't seem to be creative people who can take a mature technology and use it in a new way.     I think Joel is not being able to see the different perspectives that are needed in producing a good product. He is concentrating too much on one dimension of his candidates.

If I had to eliminate one language from that it would be smalltalk, because scheme could do the objects, but I think it is entirely reasonable to teach 4 languages in the course of a 4-year curriculum.  I read somewhere that there is a CS course somewhere in which the students do an assignment every few weeks, each time in a different language.  Anyone know where that is taught?     as an aside, I omit perl/python/ruby because they tend to be rapid uptake languages, and they are fairly popular anyway.  Better to expose the kids to something they might not see otherwise, unless you are trying to teach a vocational degree, in which case java is probably a good call, as is cobol.  [EOC]'

p751
aS"[SOC] I think the most interesting point in the essay is that Joel wants to hire people from, eg. Duke, but is worried about doing so because it is hard to tell the Duke students who don't understand recursion because they have only coded in java from the Duke students who just aren't smart enough to recurse.  This is supposed to be part of what college is for, but since the CS depts are dropping the ball, there is a niche open for a sort of DeVry-for-cool-languages-and-techniques, where you can prove competence in scheme, haskell, asm, etc., instead of with java.  The placement rates post-graduation for such an institution would probably be excellent, assuming anyone passed.  I guess it would have to be set up like a certification or something similar, because the size of the student body would not justify a school-scale operation.  Perhaps local language organizations like LispNYC and Bothton would be the proper vehicle. [EOC]"
p752
aS'[SOC] Iowa State University, while a fine place in many ways, teaches Java to CS freshmen in such a boringly basic way that Joel\'s words on "taking multiple-choice quizzicles on the difference between polymorphism and overloading" rang very true. If you want a good introductory programming class at ISU, try EE 185. It teaches C programming for EE freshmen, and it\'s well done.    If I had my way, the CS introductory class would use SICP and water it down as much as necessary instead of this silly Java-monkey factory class they feed the CS students. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] I find this article a bit frustrating. I at least agree with him on the values of teaching pointers and functional languages, but trivializing Software Engineering concepts and dismissing them to be nothing more than memory games?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like he's complaining about how there's a lack of challenge in the obstacles used to train the code commandos that he deems fit for hiring. HR drones?

And functional courses are good, but when I went we did the functional stuff first, which was near impossible. I would have preferred it the other way around, but perhaps the idea was to scare people. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] A very interesting article. However, I don't agree with their method of measuring peace by simply measuring the number of armed conflicts:      By 2003, there were 40 percent fewer conflicts than     in 1992. The deadliest conflicts -- those with 1,000     or more battle-deaths -- fell by some 80 percent.    That's fine, but that doesn't tell me jack about the overall number of deaths and casualties.    What's worse -- 100 conflicts with 1,000 deaths each, or 20 conflicts with 30,000 deaths each? What's worse -- 100  minor terrorist attacks  say, anthrax letters , or a single terrorist attack with 3,000 deaths? And is a single World War with tens of millions dead better than 100 local wars with 1,000 deaths each?    I really dunno. And actually, doing such cold math with human lives is kinda scary and distasteful, so that's not my point.     My point is that I would prefer that we measured peace not by measuring the number of conflicts you can be killed in, but rather by measuring your overall *chance* to avoid being involved into *any* conflict during your lifetime plus your *average chance of surviving a conflict* once you do get involved into one.

It\'s odd that he used a low level language like C and mixed it with a very high level language like Lisp  which is full of those abstractions that Joel used to not like, but has somehow changed his tune in the last few months .    The title of this article should have been "Ok guys, I started actually reading what Paul Graham had to say--even included him in a book of mine, had him over for dinner, and I\'m no longer going to talk smack about functional programming/languages."

p774
aS'[SOC] That is commonly believed but not accurate.  C is a fairly bad assembler, as can be testified by anyone who has compiled basicly any functional language to C.  It is fairly hard to support multiple-value-return, continuations are a bit of a bear, and fast function call interfaces such as those used by Ocaml are not possible  at least, not portably .  For something to be an assembler, you would want to be able to get at the stack, which you cannot do  directly  in C.  Java is even worse as an assembler, and it gets used as an assembler sometimes.  I dearly hope that it does not become the de facto standard assembly the way C has.  It limits implementors in much the same way that semantically poor languages limit the programmer, and limiting the implementors hurts all of us.  As to low-level teaching languages, perhaps it would be useful to have a teaching architecture, like MMIX or the apple II or the amiga-all of them are probably understandable by a single person, and they are all a lot simpler than most current chips.   well, maybe not RISC-y ones, but surely x86  [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] That is an excellent point.  It\'s funny how functional programming is "in the air" now-lots of surprising people have commented on how it is a win, or just dropped references to it.

Haskell has Simon Peyton-Jones at MSFT, and Autrijus Tang, and a ton of the smartest perl guys.      The phenomenon of being "in the air" is itself very interesting.  I see it a bit in essays http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/why-you-should-blog.html  and once in fiction, in The Fountainhead.

aS'[SOC] I enjoyed the essay. It reminded me of a passage in the book I am currently reading, The Midnight Disease: http://books.google.com/books?q=the+midnight+disease    The book contains a whole section on procrastination [pp.114-117] and the passage I remembered is on page 117:    "Attempts to improve \'time management\' fail because the procrastinator generally knows exactly when he should be doing what, but simply cannot bring himself to do it."    It struck me that this passage and Graham\'s essay point to the underlying problem with most procrastination  in my mind at least  of being overwhelmed/having the thoughts vacuumed out of one\'s head by the problem and rarely is the problem not knowing what needs to be done.     Personally, however, I find to-do lists helpful in both remembering which problems I currently have to work on. While I admit, often these include errands, they include the occasional \'big problem\'/\'big idea\' and the attempted solution or implementation of the problem/idea inevitably gets worked out/outlined in a series of to-do lists.     Perhaps my definition of to-do list is a bit off, though.  Really in some cases, it is more of an outline     Nonetheless, "The Midnight Disease" is a good book, and definitely a different sort of manual for writers. I think I\'ll return to reading it now, instead of posting muddle-headed comments. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] No,  definitely Ruby instead of Python.  Ruby has real lambdas  for the functional stuff  and continuations  for the Scheme fans ... let the language wars begin ;-     I think Lisp and Smalltalk should be taught at some point early on because these are the classics.  Then point out that between the invention of Lisp  which is getting to be about 50 years old now  and Smalltalk  which is what, about 35 years old now  til now, there really hasn't been much in terms of new programming paradigms invented.    Really, I think what we're seeing in a lot of cases is that the C/C++ schools have become Java schools.  A lot of schools haven't been teaching the classics  for quite some time now because they've essentially become vocational schools. [EOC]"

By walking instead of running your front-surface no longer stacks up rain, leaving only what falls on the much smaller top-surface. How much of a difference this makes will depend on how fast a rain drop falls and your front/top surface ratio, and I'm not doing the math.     Given that they were using fans, and weren't taking rain direction into account, this could be why the Mythbusters originally got it wrong  [EOC]"

In my opinion, flagging articles as duplicates serves only to draw acclaim to the original poster for finding it first.  This seems to me an idea which would focus rather too much on 'rewarding' posters, rather than simply getting on with the job of indexing interesting links.

aS"[SOC] Recursion is crippled in java because java does not do tail-call optimization.  If you wrote some java that did this:  pardon my lack of correct java syntax   length List l, int acc   {  if  l.isEmpty == true          return acc;     else         return length l.next, acc + 1 ;  }  you would eat an number of stack frames proportional to the length of the list.  If it is a circular list, you would run out of stack.   does anyone know what java does in this case?   In scheme, you would use a constant amount of stack, because  it is trivially provable that the return value of the function is just going to be passed up the stack anyway, so no new stack frames are allocated-the same one just gets recycled.  You can do this even if you have multiple functions calling one another.  Because recursion is so crippled in java relative to scheme, no one uses it in java, compared to the situation in scheme.  It's like lambda in python: it's there but so borked that it is rarely used.    I think this is not an implementation issue, but rather a spec issue  ie. java is specified NOT to do tail-call optimization .  Any language lawyers in the house know the answer on that? [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] "In general I agree. I know a thing or two about recursion but hardly anything about pointers. I\'m a self taught programmer of seven years but I realize these deficiencies and so read books like "Writing Great Code"  by the inventor of High Level Assembler  and "Database in Depth" by C.J. Date, and thereby hope I differentiate myself from most of todays CS Grads."    If you program in Java, you had damn well better understand pointers. Or rather, you had better understand Java\'s references, which are safer than C-style pointers but which still have the same potential for problems with referential transparency and weird side-effect mazes. This is important in almost all languages; you can only truly escape it if you use a purely functional language like Haskell, and then only if you don\'t use the special syntax for imitating side-effects with state-transition monads.    "But I program in Java, and there are some "weedout" concepts, interfaces being the one that first springs to mind. I once heard interfaces called "architecture enablers" and maybe that is the difference between Java and the previous languages that were taught in CS courses."    You think that interfaces are a difficult concept to grasp? They just reflect the common OO practice of making similar objects support the same methods for certain purposes. They\'re not even the best way of doing it; why doesn\'t Java allow you to specify that some variable must implement *multiple* interfaces? Haskell\'s type classes, which are very similar to interfaces, allow this, so it can\'t be too difficult to type-check, and the syntax wouldn\'t be too hard to understand.    "Not having to worry about pointers allows one to more quickly get to the point of being able to \'architect\' a solution."    Guess what? SICP, which uses Scheme as a teaching language, doesn\'t get to anything even vaguely pointer-like until chapter 3---and there are only 5 chapters. There are plenty of other languages which have less pointer crap to worry about than Java, and are easier to learn too, so students can get into the difficult concepts faster instead of dinking around with the syntax of a for loop.    Your ignorance is showing, and you don\'t seem to realize it. Please, learn Scheme and ML. It should be an eye-opening experience for you.    "Just be sure you hire Java programmers who grok interfaces, and for heavens sake stay away from PHP coders!"    Any Java programmer who doesn\'t even understand such a simple concept as interfaces shouldn\'t be hired, I agree. However, I fail to see the problem with PHP coders. If someone knows *only* PHP, of course they should probably be avoided, but PHP is a decent language for certain things. It\'s also terrifically easy to learn if you already know some other languages in the C family; I picked up enough PHP in a few minutes to write a simple database-and-email script, and I\'m not a genius.

aS'[SOC] He\'s not saying that Java is bad because it can\'t do recursion. He\'s saying that:    1  Young people given a choice of language to implement a problem will choose Java because that\'s what they know because  2  lots of colleges are teaching everything in Java, and  3  it\'s a lot easier to skate by without really learning how to be a good programmer because Java never *requires* you to use "difficult" concepts like pointers or recursion, and  4  the schools that teach with Java generally fail to find other ways to either "weed out" the people who can\'t handle it or actually teach them to be really good programmers.    This might mean that Joel has to deal with more resumes from mediocre programmers, but I don\'t think he is saying that he can\'t judge someone in an interview. In fact he doesn\'t even say that he is personally having to wade through more bad programmers, or that people shouldn\'t use Java when they interview with him. It\'s just the jumping off point where he observes that more people are more familiar with Java than they used to be, why this is, and what he thinks it means. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] Let me let you in on a dirty little secret -- at MIT, the same place where we teach Scheme and 6.001 to freshmen, we teach *Java* for the upper-level, software engineering course  6.170 ! Heavens!    Why? Because for many of the principles of software engineering: data hiding, code reuse  taking advantage of standard libraries, in particular , unit testing, it is most appropriate.    I know that there are those of you in the back of the classroom who snicker when you hear the phrase software engineering. You enjoy your functional language and have great disdain for Java. I bet that those of you who hold that viewpoint don't work on many software projects that are too large for you to have written yourself, or on large bodies of legacy code where half of the original authors of the codebase are now at another company, so you can no longer ask them what their code does.    When you start to find yourself in this situation, it's more helpful to do defensive programming than daredevil programming. A reference shouldn't be changed or a method shouldn't be overridden? Then declare it final in Java so the new guy who is working on the codebase can't override it. You can't do that in LISP because that's not LISP's philosophy: data and code are indistinguishable so nothing is really hidden if you cdr enough times.    Finally, there are many ways to think abstractly; certainly pointers and recursion aren't the only ones.

aS'[SOC] You might be a good guy to ask this then:  what exactly IS "software engineering"?  If it\'s data hiding, code reuse, and unit testing, then I don\'t see how that is qualitatively different than developing at a repl in any language that supports functions and closures.   Closures hide data, functions reuse code, and a repl allows you to test bits of code at a time.   Is it just MORE of the above?      As far as java being the best language for software engineering, that is an interesting statement.  I know of a bunch of very large systems written in C  too many to list , and some in C++ a lot of windows, for one , and some in various lisps  axiom, macsyma, genera, emacs , but the only 10^6 LOC thing I can think of in java is Eclipse, or maybe java itself.  Is there some other big java codebase?  And what features of java do you think make it good for s.e.?  I have been told that the package system is very nice, but never why that is so. [EOC]'

[EOC]'
p844
aS'[SOC] When I program in Lisp, a language noted for making widespread use of recursion, I normally do not write tail-recursive functions.  This is true to a lesser extent even in Haskell.  Most tail-recursive functions are instances of broader patterns which have already been identified and abstracted out, so I just use the abstractions.    The place where recursion really shines, even in languages which have all the common patterns abstracted out, is in manipulation of tree data structures. This sort of code usually doesn\'t lend itself easily to tail-call optimization, but it usually also doesn\'t create too many stack frames.    I\'d say that the real reasons people don\'t use recursion as much in Java are these:    1. There\'s a widespread uneasiness about using recursion because it\'s commonly seen as very slow and prone to stack overflows. This doesn\'t have to be true, and in many languages it isn\'t, but in Java there is some cost to recursion. But this isn\'t a reason to avoid recursion in general, since the speed penalty is usually negligible.    2. Lots of people just don\'t get recursion. It is with considerable scorn that I note this, since recursion seems so easy.    3. Recursion is often taught as a scary thing. "Beware, my students, and have your wits about you! For today, we\'re going to learn about a dark and scary thing called \'recursion\'. It\'s slower than iterative versions, and it\'s often hard to understand! Feeeeeeeaaaar!" [EOC]'

Lisp and Algol are very successful languages in this manner, in that Algol-ish syntax has dominated pretty much all of the mainstream languages for a long time, and lisp semantics have been ported over, a tiny piece at a time, to other languages.  Java did not have much technical innovation, so it will not get the type of success that lisp did, nor will it have algol-type success, because it\'s syntax is not all that new.  Instead it has Cobol-type success: it is used by tons of programmers to write tons of code.  Make of that what you will, but it is not the sort of success that Graham is talking about. [EOC]'

p857
aS'[SOC] Personally, I would define software engineering as "managing large software systems." And by large, I mean too big for an individual person to be completely familiar with. I didn\'t try to claim that Java is the _best_ language for software engineering; I\'m arguing that it has properties that make large codebases easier to manage, hence a better vehicle for teaching software engineering.    Yes, functions reuse code, and every language has some idea of a function, subroutine, method, what have you, but I think that the standard library that comes with Java has much more to offer than what you get with other languages. You\'ll notice that it is quite consistent in terms of naming conventions and other things, which is impressive for a library of its size. This is code reuse on a larger scale than we see in other languages.    Another property that helps with managing large codebases is namespaces. Without namespaces, it is difficult to produce a large codebase and be certain that there won\'t be naming collisions if you need to make it work with another large codebase  suppose your software company acquires another one, for example -- again, this isn\'t a problem that you and your buddies face when hacking together -- I\'m talking about something on a larger scale than that .    I concede that the REPL is a huge tool, which is why I use the DrJava plugin for Eclipse when I use Java. I hate the name, but it allows me to execute Java statements and try things out without creating a throwaway class with a main   method.  [shamelessPlug]If you\'re a JavaScript hacker, then you may want to check out my Chickenfoot extension for Firefox, which offers something of a REPL for JavaScript, plus a lot more[/shamelessPlug].     The tools for refactoring in Java have become very good  as I said, I use Eclipse , which is also important when it comes to managing large codebases. In most languages, if you want to rename a variable in your code, then you run perl minus pie to rename it everywhere, cross your fingers, and hope that you didn\'t break anything. With tools like Eclipse, you can do that renaming such that you know that you haven\'t changed the behavior of your program.  Renaming a variable may be a weak example, extracting methods/interfaces are more compelling refactorings that Eclipse can do, but it\'s not as clear what the analogue is in some other languages, which is why I used the renaming example.     This is not to say that such refactoring tools could not exist in other languages  in particular, functional programming languages , but I haven\'t seen them yet. Because Java is a bit of a control freak  to the dismay of "Real Hackers" , creating such tools is easier to do for Java. There is certainly a fair bit of research going on to make analogous tools in other languages, but until they come to fruition, I think that teaching Java with Eclipse is a better way to teach software engineering.    I was a TA for 6.170 for three semesters at MIT, and I started the movement from Emacs to Eclipse. Since Eclipse made it so easy to run unit tests and interact with CVS, which I think are also important practices for a software developer, I thought it was clearly the way to go. As you can imagine, some students/faculty thought otherwise, but that\'s a whole different discussion.*    *For the record, no student  or faculty member :  was forced to use Eclipse in 6.170: students have always been free to use whatever tools they want. You can bet that we had, and will continue to have, die-hards who insist on using Emacs and checking in their code from the command line. I\'ve forgotten the -kb flag enough times to convince me that it isn\'t the way to go, but that\'s just my opinion. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] Even Scheme, you say? Nifty. I guess that only leaves JavaScript without packages or namespaces, which a big pain, with respect to all the AJAX stuff going on recently.    In terms of existing package/namespace systems, I can\'t speak to all of the languages you list, but right now, I\'m looking at the Java 1.5 API  http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html , and I\'m trying to compare it to the equivalent Python API to see how its packages are organized, but I\'m not sure whether the Python Library Reference  http://docs.python.org/lib/lib.html  is what I\'m looking for  if this is the right site, then Python\'s packages sure appear more disorganized than Java\'s.  Classes in Java packages can also have data members that can be only accessed by other classes in the same package -- I\'m not sure if the languages you list add that ability as part of their package system.    Finally, no, 6.170 students must code in Java for 6.170. Grading student code is difficult enough as it is -- I can\'t imagine what it would be like if we let students write in any language. Such variety would be a nightmare for our automated test suite and the other tools we use to help with grading  which are written in Python, incidentally .    I don\'t know what you mean by "x," but I believe that the last language that was used for 6.170 was CLU, which is a language that was invented at MIT. It was one of the first  if not the first  languages to focus on data abstraction and I\'m told it had nice iterators and exception handling, so I suppose this was a good choice for 6.170 back in the day. My best guess as to why they switched to Java  in the late 90s, I believe  is that it looked like Java was going somewhere and CLU wasn\'t  which certainly turned out to be true . Because of the switch, students have been able to make some fantastic final projects since they can leverage third-party libraries written in Java, such as OpenGL, which is a lot more fun than doing a project without such libraries. I also think it\'s important that there is at least one course in the CS curriculum that exposes students to tools that people use in the real world  CVS, Eclipse  as opposed to tools that were made for and by MIT  Edwin the Scheme editor .

aS'[SOC] Chu, I just can\'t quite get my head around your comment:   According to wikipedia, honour killing is forbidden by Sharia and may have Roman and European origins.      Your\'re begging the question here.  Obviously the ban isn\'t very effective, at least in Pakistan.  And who cares about the Western origins of honor killing --never mind that you must have to go back 1000 years-- when the practice is so abhorrent to Westerners now?  The question remains unaddressed: what could possibly motivate hundreds of men to "slaughter [their] dishonored daughters" like this? [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] hmmm ... i wonder what you're alluding to. i for one, i'm voting this down. [EOC]"

aS'[SOC] Please.  His main bone of contention seems to be that singletons are stupid because he used to do stupid things with them - used them for things they shouldn\'t have been used for.    Then he "discovered" static methods, which made him realize that he was using singletons stupidly.  Excuse me, which made him realize that singletons are stupid.    Wow, what a superb programmer, with such a well thought position. [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] Really? I thought Sergey went to University of Maryland and didn't Omid Kordestani go to San Jose State? What about Alan Eustace, didn't he get his PhD from the University of South Florida?     My point is that limiting yourself ONLY to certain types of candidates from certain elite schools is shooting yourself in the foot. Too many attributes that make up a successful person are not measurable. Joel seems to ignore that fact.     Does Joel think that a college admission board is able to determine the full life potential of a seventeen-year-old person?     One other thing, how many women work for Joel.  I only saw pictures of men that participated on that Aardvark project.  I went to all male private schools and I for one appreciate, at the very least, the calming influence on the male ego when a woman is present during a meeting. Especially during a code review session!     [EOC]"

aS'[SOC]   Your\'re begging the question here.    Well Wikipedia is.      Obviously the ban isn\'t very effective    So obviously these people are not that influenced by Islam.      And who cares about the Western origins of honor killing --never mind that you must have to go back 1000 years--     The point is that honour killings have been widespread in many societies throughout history. It\'s not an Islamic or Arab thing.       The question remains unaddressed: what could possibly motivate hundreds of men to "slaughter [their] dishonored daughters" like this?    It\'s a good question. We know it\'s not Islam and we know that it has happened in many societies. Do you have a theory?   [EOC]'
p910
aS'[SOC] When are people going to get over the whole "I am an angry dad, I distrust my daughters so much that I must intimidate others to force her to behave" thing?  Was never funny, was never clever.      A few times I was given little \'talks\' by the fathers of girlfriends while in high school.  I lived in Nebraska so those all meant they showed me their gun collection at some point during the "gettting to know you talk."    If I was to the point that I was "dating" their daughters and thus subject to the introductory chat, chances are I had already had sex with their daughter.  Really it just gave me incentive to convince them to have sex with me on their parent\'s bed.      I\'m still a few years from having kids of my own, and many more before I have a child old enough to date, but I hope I am not so big a dick to make it a point to intimidate with threats of physical violence any boy my daughter might date.      And that\'s why I feel John Ritter got exactly what he deserved. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] This is how the left needs to approach political elections: as marketing to different segmnets using correct media for each. [EOC]'
p912
aS'[SOC] All it needed was some poop jokes and a monkey. [EOC]'
p913
aS'[SOC] "Consumers buy crap that is of absolutely no practical use to them  and is sometimes even harmful to them  every day."    This is a ridiculous statement. While it is, strictly speaking, true  certainly at least one consumer buys something useless every day , it is misleading because almost all transactions are beneficial to both parties, otherwise they wouldn\'t be made. Just because _you_ think someone else doesn\'t really "need" something doesn\'t mean it\'s true.    The idea that people can\'t take care of themselves is a central part of a certain mythology. This same mythology also leads people to think, "How could people possibly vote for a right-wing party? They simply must be brainwashed - there is no other explanation." Wake up, people: there actually are conservatives in the world who believe in their philosophy. [EOC]'
p914
aS'[SOC] This is a great reference to keep handy for all those times you hear someone name the ACLU as part of the Secular War on Christianity. Defending the right to sing "Awesome God" at a talent show or the right to preach on a street corner in Vegas are not exactly consistent with a conspiracy to destroy Christianity.    It would be nice if some of the entries had somre more details, or at least a link to the specific case, though.   [EOC]'

aS"[SOC] Relax, it's funny. [EOC]"

aS"[SOC] I have never been a fan of dell quality. But of late it seems to have taken a turn for the worse. They wouldn't need to do support on the cheap if they had reasonable products.    STOP BUYING DELL PEOPLE ! PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN !   [EOC]"
p917
aS'[SOC] yeah - for things like web apps I really like the "opinionated" approach - only really one way to do things. I suffer from analysis paralysis when faced with too many choices.    In in a domain like database backed web apps, all the hard problems should have been solved in the past by someone more thoughtful then me, so I appreciate the fact that I am forced to think and work there way.     its not an approach that is applicable to all areas of application development, just web apps in my opinion . [EOC]'
p918
aS"[SOC] 1   Look at the author's creditials - looks like pure propaganda to me.  Do you really believe everything you read without question and without consideration for context?    2   If you really want to verify the truth, check out a global human rights watch website.  Not saying that these figures are wrong per se, but considering points 1  and 2  I suspect this article was printed at this time to boost confidence in your government.    3   If X amount of people were murdered last year, and less-than-X was murdered this year, does it therefore follow that murder is ok?    I guess we can all feel good about the world in that case.  Carry on. [EOC]"
p919
aS'[SOC] *"I am an angry dad, I distrust my daughters so much..."*    They don\'t distrust their daughters.  They distrust *you*.  The difference is vital. [EOC]'
p920
aS"[SOC] Ugh, it's dynamically scoped. I haven't worked with dynamic scoping much, but I don't envy people trying to serious work in it.    Edit: Yeah, yeah, the compiled version is lexically scoped, I should have read the next line. I don't think it is a good approach, though. [EOC]"
p921
aS'[SOC] "It\'s a good question. We know it\'s not Islam and we know that it has happened in many societies. Do you have a theory?"    Uh, could it be that some men are psycho control freaks, and any excuse will do?   [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] The pharmicutical industry is corrupt beyond belief.  Just google "Big pharma" for more info than you could read in 3 lifetimes. [EOC]'

aS'[SOC] There seems to be a problem right now... [EOC]'
p926
aS'[SOC] The difference between the left and the right is that the right actually respects the left as an adversary.  And that is why they win. [EOC]'
p927
aS"[SOC] Yes. There are legitimate skeptics of strongly-typed, OO languages like Graham. Now comes their legion of PHP-using teenagers who just wanted a reason to feel superior to people who've at least actually *read* GoF. [EOC]"
p928
aS'[SOC] from the docs:    "The main differences between Lush and CLush are as follows:    ...    * CLush uses lexical scoping, while Lush uses dynamic variable binding  if you don\'t know the difference, don\'t worry . "    So it is lexically scoped *if* you\'re using Compiled Lush, otherwise it\'s dynamically scoped [EOC]'
p929
aS'[SOC] "This is a great reference to keep handy for all those times you hear someone name the ACLU as part of the Secular War on Christianity."....    Yeah, if you want to amuse others with your gullibility in buying these examples of cynically calculated "exceptions to the rule". The ACLU is reprehensible. [EOC]'
p930
aS"[SOC] I've noticed that real sysadmins bitch about Dells considerably less than your average CIS student. Because of this, I am inclined to think that people choose Dell to complain about not because they have more problems than competitors at the same price points, but because they are the most popular and are therefore an obvious target.
